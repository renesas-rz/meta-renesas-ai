Subject: [PATCH] tensorflow: lite: Do not build XNNPack into library output

For benchmarking purposes we need to be able to change the delegate
at runtime however there is still a need to be able to enable and
link against the XNNPack library. For this we build XNNPack but do not
add it to libtensorflow-lite.a or enable it by default.
